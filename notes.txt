int hitPoints;
    int remainingHitPoints;

bool takeAttack(int attackDmg) {
      cout << "receiving attack" << endl;
      if (remainingHitPoints - attackDmg < 1) {
        remainingHitPoints = 0;
        cout << "Fatal Blow" << endl;
        return 1;
      }
      else {
        cout << attackDmg << " ATTACK" << endl;
        remainingHitPoints -= attackDmg;
        return 0;
      }
    }


now replace the remainign hitpoints initializations to add remaining hitpoints
